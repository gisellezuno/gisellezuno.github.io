## CPSC 120

* Lab 6, part 2

    This was my favorite lab because although it was a bit difficult at first, I took away the most knowledge from it. I learned how to play the game Blackjack, how to use if statements, learned about “bool”, command line, arguments, and more. Now, this successful program can tell whether or not a card is a bust in the game of Blackjack, turning a well-known game into a computer program. It was definitely satisfying to figure out. 

* Lab 7, part 1

    This is my second favorite lab because I liked making a program that had a practical, real-life use. This program considered parking rules and signs to determine whether someone could or could not park on certain days and hours with those rules and signs in mind. I had to use if-statements, if-else statements, provide arguments, print error messages, and more. This made me think back to a discussion on how programmers have important work to do because their work can have real-life consequences.

* Lab 8, part 2

    I liked this lab because I initially really struggled with for-loops and while loops, but this lab created a stronger foundation for me to learn. This lab had to do with writing outer, inner loops, incrementing, decrementing all to make a simple pattern. I played a lot with the loops, and it took a lot of visualization in my head to figure it out, but nonetheless it was fun.
